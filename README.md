# -Patient-Centric-Drug-Selection-using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on using machine learning to predict the right medication for patients based on factors like age, sex, blood pressure, and more. Aimed at beginners, it offers hands-on experience in data analysis, model building, and evaluation. By navigating this real-world challenge, you'll learn how to handle medical data and apply machine learning concepts to improve patient care through accurate drug predictions.

The dataset comprises essential patient attributes, including age, sex, blood pressure levels (BP), cholesterol levels, and the sodium-to-potassium ratio. The primary focus is on predicting the optimal drug type for patients based on these features, enabling personalized and effective medical treatment decisions. This dataset offers a unique opportunity to explore machine learning techniques in healthcare, aiming to enhance patient outcomes through precise drug predictions

Technologies used:

Language - Python

Algorithms - Logistic Regression, Gaussian NB, Decision Tree and Random forest

# Process 
(1) Importing the data

(2) Checking null values 

(3) Checking data types  

(4) Exploring data distribution and summary statistics

(5) Examining the count of the target variable

(6) Data grouping and cleaning 

(7) Count plot on each column to understand the imbalance

(8) Splitting into train and test set

(9) Encoding and sampling 

(10) Fitting into the machine learning model for logistic regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random forest.

(11) Use the best model to predict which drug type a patient should be prescribed from the sample data
